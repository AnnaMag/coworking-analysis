t is the first kind of economy where imagination and ingenuity decide what people want to do and make. And what they want to buy.

The largest sectors are art, culture, design, entertainment, media and innovation.

These have different values and business models but are united by people who are passionate about new concepts and developing new ideas as part of their daily work. They put a higher value on what their work means.

A creative economy is measured just like any other: demand, price, profit and margins.  We also look at jobs, output and productivity.

Every new economy changes how people live. The industrial revolution brought change not only to the workplace but also to homes and cities.

The rise of the creative economy marks another sea-change in our lives. It is leading to new ideas about how and where people work and is beginning to re-shape our cities. It is disrupting relationships between workers and managers and investors. It is driving the new digital start-ups, affecting education, and changing the nature of jobs and employment.

At the heart of today’s changes is the private determination of individuals to think of new and often surprising ideas that might stimulate others. Brought together, these people are fuelling the creative economy and shaping the future.

Artistic services and intellectual capital are inarguably essential to the 21st 
century economy, which is dynamic, knowledge-based, and increasingly global. 
Indeed, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s 
Creative Economy Report 2010 asserts: “Adequately nurtured, creativity fuels culture, 
infuses a human-centred [sic] development and constitutes the key ingredient 
for job creation, innovation and trade while contributing to social inclusion, 
cultural diversity and environmental sustainability.”

The creative economy consists of the transactions in … creative products. Each transaction may have two complementary values, the value of the intangible, intellectual property and the value of the physical carrier or platform (if any).  In some industries, such as digital software, the intellectual property value is higher. In others, such as art, the unit cost of the physical object is higher.
(John Howkins, The Creative Economy)

Today’s economy is fundamentally a Creative Economy. I certainly agree with those who say that the advanced nations are shifting to information-based, knowledge-driven economies… Yet I see creativity… as the key driver. In my formulation, ‘knowledge’ and ‘information’ are the tools and materials of creativity.
(Richard Florida, The Rise of the Creative Class)

Measuring the value of the creative economy is not easy and depends on which definition you adopt. However it is already a significant proportion of the world economy, particularly in the more developed areas. The following estimates are from the Work Foundation report, based on figures published in 2004 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development:
